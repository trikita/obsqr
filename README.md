Requirements
------------

To make it run on your Android device you need to have Android 4.0 or higher,
and of course your device should have a camera.

Build
-----

obsqr uses zbar library to decode QR images. Zbar sources has been added into
libzbar subdirectory, modified to be compiled with NDK, also added minimal
iconv implementation.

Since Android NDK is still a second-class citizen - the best way to deal with
native code is to build it manually, then copy `*.so` into `src/zbar/jniLibs`
of the main project tree.

To rebuild ZBar from the sources (optional step):

```bash
cd libzbar
export NDK_PATH=/path/to/your/ndk
NDK_PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd) $NDK_PATH/ndk-build
cp -rv libs/* ../src/zbar/jniLibs/
```

To build obsqr APK:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

To run tests:

```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
